# Object_detection_and_tracking
This repository implements object detection and tracking using OpenCV. It provides the functionality to detect and track objects across video frames using different tracking algorithms. The detection is performed using pre-trained deep learning models, and object tracking is achieved with OpenCVâ€™s built-in tracking algorithms.
## Features
**Object Detection**: Detect objects in video frames using a pre-trained deep learning model.
**Object Tracking**: Track detected objects over time across video frames.
**Supported Trackers**:
- BOOSTING
- MILK
- CFTLD
- MEDIAN
- FLOW
- MOSSE
- CSRT
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Object_detection_and_tracking.git
   ## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Object_detection_and_tracking.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Object_detection_and_tracking
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Object Detector and Tracker

1. Place your input video in the project directory. A sample video (`Group Therapy for Autism Spectrum Disorder.mp4`) is included.
2. Run the `Object detection and Tracking.ipynb` script to start the object detection and tracking process:

   ```bash
   python Object detection and Tracking.ipynb
   ```
