# Object_detection_and_tracking
This repository implements object detection and tracking using OpenCV. It provides the functionality to detect and track objects across video frames using different tracking algorithms. The detection is performed using pre-trained deep learning models, and object tracking is achieved with OpenCVâ€™s built-in tracking algorithms.
## Features
**Object Detection**: Detect objects in video frames using a pre-trained deep learning model.
**Object Tracking**: Track detected objects over time across video frames.
**Supported Trackers**:
- BOOSTING
- MILK
- CFTLD
- MEDIAN
- FLOW
- MOSSE
- CSRT
